# static-website
This Terraform project automates the deployment of a static website on AWS. It sets up the necessary infrastructure components such as Route 53 for DNS, an S3 bucket for storing website content, CloudFront for content delivery, and a CodePipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) from a GitHub repository.
