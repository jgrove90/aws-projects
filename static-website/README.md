# static-website
This project automates the deployment of a static website on AWS using Terraform. It sets up the necessary infrastructure components such as an S3 bucket for storing website content, CloudFront for content delivery, configuring Cloudflare as a DNS service, and CodePipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) from this GitHub repository.
